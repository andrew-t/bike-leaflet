# cycle-mcr
A very quick mobile-friendly version of http://tfgm.pindarcreative.co.uk/maps/default.asp

TFGM have a rather nice set of cycle maps at http://cycling.tfgm.com/Pages/Cycle-Maps.aspx including a [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)-based one at http://tfgm.pindarcreative.co.uk/maps/default.asp made by [Pindar](http://www.pindarcreative.co.uk/). (The PDF and Leaflet versions show different information and I've no way of knowing which is the most up to date.) Unfortunately, their implementation isn't very mobile-friendly, which means you can't really use it while out and about.

I've made a tiny wrapper around their backend which gives a nice mobile interface and adds GPS support.
